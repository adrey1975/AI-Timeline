# AI History Timeline Widget

An interactive educational widget designed for 3rd-grade students to learn about the history of Artificial Intelligence through a drag-and-drop timeline activity.

## Overview

This widget allows students to arrange historical AI events in chronological order. It features:
- Drag-and-drop functionality
- Interactive cards with emojis/images
- Immediate feedback
- Reset capability
- Responsive design
- Kid-friendly interface

## File Structure

```
ai-timeline-widget/
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML structure
â”œâ”€â”€ styles.css        # Styling and animations
â”œâ”€â”€ script.js         # Game logic and event handling
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # This documentation
```

## How It Works

1. Students are presented with shuffled event cards at the top of the screen
2. They drag and drop cards into timeline slots below
3. Cards can be:
   - Moved from the top container to any slot
   - Swapped between timeline slots
   - Moved back to the top container
4. Students can check their answer or reset the game at any time

## Customization Guide

### Adding or Modifying Events

Edit the `timelineEvents` array in `script.js`:

```javascript
const timelineEvents = [
    {
        year: "1950",
        event: "Description of the event",
        image: "ðŸ¤”"  // Can be emoji or image object
    }
    // Add more events here
];
```

### Using Images Instead of Emojis

Replace emoji with an image object:

```javascript
{
    year: "1950",
    event: "Description",
    image: {
        src: "path/to/image.png",
        alt: "Image description"
    }
}
```

### Styling Modifications

#### Colors
The widget uses CSS variables for easy color customization. In `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
    --blue: rgb(92, 113, 242);
    --blue-dark: rgb(51, 56, 118);
    /* ... other color variables ... */
}
```

#### Card Appearance
Modify card styles in `styles.css`:
- `.card` - Basic card styling
- `.card .image-container` - Image/emoji container
- `.card .year` - Year display
- `.card .event` - Event description

#### Timeline Appearance
Customize timeline in `styles.css`:
- `.timeline-container` - Overall timeline container
- `.timeline::before` - The timeline line
- `.timeline-slot` - Individual slot styling

### Responsive Breakpoints

Mobile responsiveness can be adjusted in the media query section of `styles.css`:

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
    /* Mobile-specific styles */
}
```

## Accessibility Features

- Semantic HTML structure
- Clear visual hierarchy
- High contrast colors
- Responsive text sizing
- Clear feedback messages
- Keyboard-friendly interactions

## Browser Support

The widget works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Safari (latest)
- Edge (latest)
